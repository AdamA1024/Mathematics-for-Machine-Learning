# Machine-Learning-for-Mathematics-Coursera
This repository contains the code for all the programming tasks of the Machine Learning for Mathematics courses taught at Coursera by Imperial College London:

## Linear Algebra ([link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning))

* [Identifying Special Matrices](IdentifyingSpecialMatrices.ipynb)
* [Gram-Schmidt Process](GramSchmidtProcess.ipynb)
* [Reflecting Bear](linear-algebra/ReflectingBear.ipynb)
* [PageRank](PageRank.ipynb)

I've posted the answers here with the intent that it helps with debugging your own. I encourage you not to copy from the resources, but to understand why your code/answers might not have worked. The discussion forums are really helpful, and I recommend asking for help there before using the resources posted here.
